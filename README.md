# Guide

1. After you finish launching VSCode, a greeting will pop up. You can customize it in the settings.

2. We have registered the command <font color="yellow">**"File Information"**</font> in the context menu, which you can click on to view the current file size, creation time, modification time, and file path.

3. More features are still in development, so stay tuned~

# Help

1. You can open Settings and search for <font color="yellow">**"Hello Config"**</font> to modify the default settings.

2. If the settings don't meet your needs, you can customize the greeting by reading the <font color="yellow">**"extension.js"**</font> file.</br>You can find this file in the VSCode plugin directory.</br>On my computer this path is C:/Users/86157/.vscode/extensions/lovescript.not-noly-hello-0.1.0/extension.js.
