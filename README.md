# More

1. You can open Settings and search for <font color="blue">**"Hello Config"**</font> to modify the default settings.

2. If the settings don't meet your needs, you can customize the greeting by reading the <font color="blue">**"include"**</font> folder.You can find this file in the VSCode plugin directory.</br>On my computer this path is C:/Users/86157/.vscode/extensions/lovescript.not-noly-hello-0.1.0/include/.

3. The method used to run the executable is to enter commands into the terminal through VSCode's API.

4. You can find the command "打开hello .txt" in the command bar, where you can edit random greetings, each line represents a greeting, and no blank lines appear.
